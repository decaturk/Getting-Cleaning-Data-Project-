More information on features in `features_info.txt`, included in the raw data.


## Summary Choices

Test and Training data from the raw data were merged and treated equally.
Test and Training Subjects (by id) were assumed to represent the same subject.

For each feature variable in the raw data that represented a mean or standard deviation value, the mean was calculated 
for that variable for each Subject - Activity combination. 

## Experimental Study Design

Raw Data can be obtained here:
